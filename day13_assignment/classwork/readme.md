javascript functions used:
Date():
    A JavaScript date is fundamentally specified as the time in milliseconds that has elapsed since the epoch, which is defined as the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC (equivalent to the UNIX epoch). This timestamp is timezone-agnostic and uniquely defines an instant in history. The Date object encapsulates an integral number that represents milliseconds since the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC (the epoch). The Date object also defines two static methods that are invoked through the Date() constructor itself.

getMonth():
    The getMonth() method returns the month in the specified date according to local time, as a zero-based value.

getDate():
    The getDate() method of Date instances returns the day of the month for this date according to local time.

getFullYear():
    Javascript date getFullYear() method returns the year of the specified date according to local time. The value returned by getFullYear() is an absolute number.
